# Telegram Plugin

A private Telegram bot that forwards messages to the LLM and supports Human-in-the-Loop approvals via inline keyboard buttons.

---

## Setup

1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token.
2. Add to `config.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  telegram:
    token: "123456789:AABBCC..."
```

3. Restart the app. The bot starts automatically if the token is present.

## Pairing — how to authorize a user

Access control is managed entirely through the file `secrets/telegram_whitelist.json`.

### File format

```json
{
  "whitelist": [123456789],
  "pending_pairings": [
    {
      "code": "A3KX7P",
      "chat_id": 987654321,
      "issued_at": "2026-05-19T10:30:00+02:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `whitelist` — array of authorized `chat_id` values (integers). Users in this array can send messages to the agent.
- `pending_pairings` — users who have contacted the bot but are not yet authorized. Each entry has a `code` shown to the user in Telegram chat, their `chat_id`, and the `issued_at` timestamp.

### Pairing flow

1. An unknown user sends any message to the bot.
2. The bot replies with a 6-character pairing code and writes an entry to `pending_pairings` in `secrets/telegram_whitelist.json`.
3. The user communicates the code to you (e.g., through a separate channel).
4. You ask the agent: *"Telegram pairing code A3KX7P — authorize it"*.
5. The agent reads `secrets/telegram_whitelist.json`, finds the entry with `code: "A3KX7P"`, moves the `chat_id` from `pending_pairings` to `whitelist`, and writes the file back.
6. Within 10 seconds the plugin's watchdog detects the file change, logs the event, and **sends a welcome message** to the newly authorized user on Telegram.

### To authorize manually (without asking the agent)

Use `edit_file` or `write_file` to move the `chat_id` from `pending_pairings` to `whitelist` in `secrets/telegram_whitelist.json`.

### To revoke access

Remove the `chat_id` from the `whitelist` array in `secrets/telegram_whitelist.json`. The change takes effect on the user's next message (whitelist is re-read on every message).

---

## Watchdog

The plugin polls `secrets/telegram_whitelist.json` every **10 seconds** for modification-time changes.

When it detects a change:
- Reloads the whitelist.
- Identifies any `chat_id` values newly added to `whitelist`.
- Sends each newly authorized user a welcome message on Telegram.
- Logs the event at INFO level.

This means there is no restart needed after editing the file — authorization takes effect automatically.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `/new` or `/clear` | Create a new chat session (clears LLM context) |
| `/stop` | Interrupt the agent mid-turn (clears pending approvals and clarifications) |
| `/context` | Show last turn's token usage (`↑X tok · ↓Y tok`) |
| `/compact` | Force context compaction (bypasses the token threshold) |
| `/resetmcp` | Remove all activated MCP tools from the session |
| `/sethome` | Set Telegram as the home source for background notifications |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| any text | Forwarded to the LLM agent |

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Approvals

When the LLM triggers a tool that requires user approval (`execute_cmd`, `restart`, write-file tools outside `memory/`):

1. The bot sends a message with the operation details and a content preview.
2. Four inline keyboard buttons appear in two rows:

   ```text
   [✅ Approve]  [❌ Reject]
   [⏱ 15 min]   [🔄 Sessione]
   ```

3. Tapping a button resolves the pending approval and execution continues or is cancelled.
4. **⏱ 15 min** — approves and suppresses approval prompts for tools of the same category/MCP server for 15 minutes.
5. **🔄 Sessione** — approves and suppresses all approval prompts for the rest of the session.
6. The approval message is **deleted** once resolved, whether via Telegram or the web UI.

Bypass buttons call `ApprovalApi::approve_with_bypass` (scope auto-detected from the tool's category or MCP server). See [approval.md](approval.md) for bypass semantics.

## Output Formatting

Telegram's HTML parse mode supports only a limited tag set: `<b>` `<i>` `<u>` `<s>` `<code>` `<pre>` `<a>` `<blockquote>`. Structural elements (`<table>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<div>`) are **not supported**.

The plugin injects a compact formatting context into every LLM session (`TELEGRAM_FORMAT_CONTEXT` in `mod.rs`) and a shorter tail reminder (`TELEGRAM_FORMAT_REMINDER`) instructing it to:

- Use Telegram HTML tags only.
- Never use Markdown (`**`, `*`, `` ` ``, `#`, `_`, `|`).
- Replace structured data (tables) with bullet lists (`•`).

| Element         | Correct               | Wrong              |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Bold            | `<b>text</b>`         | `**text**`         |
| Italic          | `<i>text</i>`         | `*text*`           |
| Code            | `<code>text</code>`   | `` `text` ``       |
| Code block      | `<pre>text</pre>`     | ` ```text``` `     |
| Structured data | bullet list `•`       | `\| col \| col \|` |

Long responses are automatically split into chunks of ≤ 4000 characters via `send_long()` in `helpers.rs`.

### Markdown sanitizer (post-processing safety net)

Because LLMs occasionally emit Markdown despite instructions, `send_long` applies `sanitize_for_telegram()` on every HTML-mode send **before** chunking. This provides a reliable fallback independent of model compliance:

1. **Markdown tables → bullet lists** — detects `| col | col |` blocks, emits the header row as `<b>header — header</b>` and each data row as `• val — val`.
2. **`**bold**` → `<b>bold</b>`** — converts residual Markdown bold.
3. **`## Header` → `<b>Header</b>`** — converts residual Markdown headers.

### Fallback behavior

If the Telegram API rejects a chunk (e.g., due to malformed HTML), `send_long` retries **without** `ParseMode::Html`. Before retrying it strips all HTML tags (`<…>`) from the chunk using a regex so the user sees plain text rather than raw `<b>…</b>` markup.

## Voice (Speech Integration)

If the Speech plugin is configured and running, the Telegram plugin gains two additional capabilities:

### Incoming voice messages (STT)

When the user sends a voice note, the plugin:

1. Downloads the OGG audio from Telegram.
2. Passes it to `SpeechPlugin::transcribe()`.
3. Forwards the resulting text to the LLM as a normal message.

### Outgoing voice replies (TTS)

The LLM has access to a `send_voice_message(text)` tool. When it calls it, the plugin:

1. Passes the text to `SpeechPlugin::synthesize()`.
2. Sends the resulting audio back to the user as a Telegram voice message.
3. Falls back to text if synthesis fails.

The LLM is instructed to use voice only for short, conversational replies with no code or complex formatting. The TTS engine's formatting guide (SSML-like tags) is also injected into the system context so the LLM can control pacing and emphasis.

### Requirements

Both `plugins.speech.stt_model` and `plugins.speech.tts_model` must be set in `config.yml`. The Speech plugin must be enabled and running before the Telegram plugin starts.

---

## File & Media Attachments

The Telegram plugin handles incoming attachments by downloading them and injecting a `[TELEGRAM SYSTEM INFO]` message into the conversation history. The LLM sees the event in timeline order — it knows which file was most recently sent without any special indexing.

| Type | Saved to disk | Message content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Document (PDF, ZIP, …) | `uploads/telegram/<chat_id>/<filename>` | File name, MIME type, path |
| Photo | `uploads/telegram/<chat_id>/<file_id>.jpg` | Path |
| Location | — | Latitude, longitude, accuracy, Google Maps URL |

Captions (text typed alongside a file or photo) are included in the info message when present.

### Live locations

When the user shares a live location, two things happen:

1. **Initial message** (`message` event) — the LLM is notified via a `[TELEGRAM SYSTEM INFO]` message and the position is written to `skald.location_manager` under the key `"telegram"`.
2. **Subsequent updates** (`edited_message` events) — the position in `location_manager` is updated silently, with no LLM notification. This keeps the store current for any background scripts or tools that read `user_location("telegram")`.

`LocationManager` is in-memory only. On restart, the store starts empty and is repopulated as soon as Telegram delivers the next live location tick (typically within seconds if sharing is still active).

The `uploads/` directory is gitignored.

### Extending attachment types

To add a new type (e.g. sticker, contact):

1. Add a variant to `TelegramAttachment` in `src/core/plugin/telegram/attachments.rs`.
2. Implement `download_and_save` (return `Ok(None)` if no file) and `system_info_message`.
3. Detect the message type in `classify_message` in `handlers.rs` and return `IncomingEvent::Attachment(...)`.

---

## Interface Tools

The Telegram plugin can inject custom LLM-callable tools into any session via the `interface_tools` parameter of `SendMessageOptions`. These tools are only visible to the root agent — sub-agents do not inherit them.

To add a Telegram-specific tool, construct an `InterfaceTool` with an OpenAI tool definition and an async handler closure that captures `Arc<Bot>` and `ChatId`, then pass it in the `interface_tools` vec inside `SendMessageOptions`.

`InterfaceTool` and `ToolFuture` are defined in `crates/core-api/src/interface_tool.rs` (re-exported via `crate::chat_hub`). `AgentRunConfig` remains in `src/core/session/handler/interface_tools.rs` (main crate only).

---

## Secrets directory

`secrets/telegram_whitelist.json` is gitignored. The directory is created automatically on first pairing request. Never commit this file.
