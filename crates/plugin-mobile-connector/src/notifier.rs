//! Delayed push notifier.
//!
//! The mobile push for an Inbox item is only valuable when the user is *away*
//! from the computer. When they're sitting at the chat, every approval /
//! clarification would otherwise fire an instant — and pointless — phone
//! notification, since they'll answer on the computer within seconds.
//!
//! `DelayedNotifier` debounces that: when a request enters the Inbox it starts a
//! timer; only if the request is still unresolved after `delay` does it push
//! (`broadcast_inbox`). If the user resolves it on the computer first, the timer
//! is cancelled and **no** push is sent. Once a push *has* gone out, the eventual
//! resolution is broadcast so the phone clears the item.
