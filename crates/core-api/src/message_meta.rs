//! Structured, reusable metadata attached to a `chat_history` row.
//!
//! Persisted as a single JSON column (`chat_history.metadata`) and intentionally
//! generic: today it carries user file **attachments**, but new keys can be added
//! later without a schema change. Two independent readers derive different views
//! from the same source:
//!   - the **LLM context** builder appends [`attachments_block`] to the user turn,
//!   - the **history UI** renders the structured attachments as chips.
//!
//! The raw `[SYSTEM INFO]` text block is therefore never persisted — it is
//! generated on the fly from this metadata.
