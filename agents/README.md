# Agent icons — style guide

Each agent in the `agents/` directory can have an icon/avatar declared in the `"icon"` field of its `meta.json`. The backend serves the file via `GET /api/agents/{id}/icon`.

## Visual style

Icons were generated with **xAI Grok Imagine** in a **concept art / character design** style:

- **Style**: illustrated, not photorealistic, not flat vector, not anime
- **Technique**: bold brushstrokes, rich colours, depth, video game concept art quality (Overwatch / Arcane / Hades)
- **Format**: portrait (vertical rectangle)
- **Background**: medium-bright, not dark, no neon
- **Subject**: a character / living being representing the agent's role, with contextual elements (tools, holograms, symbols)
- **Palette**: varies per agent, generally warm with one dominant colour

## Adding a new agent icon

1. Generate the image using the prompt template above
2. Save it as `agents/{agent_id}/icon.png`
3. Add `"icon": "icon.png"` to the agent's `meta.json`
4. No code changes needed — the backend serves whatever file path is declared in the manifest
